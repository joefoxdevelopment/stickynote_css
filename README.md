# stickynote_css

Some CSS I plan on using in a set of my own projects.
Thought it would be nice to keep it all together.

## Usage

Simply clone the [minified css file](minified-css/stickynote.min.css) and
include it in an html file using <link rel="path_to.min.css">.

## Editing the less
Install the following.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Less](http://lesscss.org/)
* [less-plugin-clean-css](https://github.com/less/less-plugin-clean-css)
